Many of them are well known, such as a need to reduce waste and for the more robust and efficient use of health data. Arguably the trend that received the most attention pre-COVID and poses the greatest overall structural challenge is Europe’s ageing population. An ageing population (around 20 % of the EU’s population is aged over 65) means a higher prevalence of major chronic conditions, such as heart disease, stroke and cancer. It means an ever higher slice of the national budget needs to be allocated to healthcare. It means that innovative strategies to streamline and digitalise healthcare become more essential than ever. And, finally, Europe’s ageing population is likely to be one of the key reasons why it has been so badly walloped by the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of overall mortality rates.";;;;;;en;de,en,es,fr,it,pl;"2021-04-09 14:06:35";https://cordis.europa.eu/article/id/429582-transforming-european-health-systems
