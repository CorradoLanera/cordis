mag;430213;;"Ready Player... You? Welcome to the Virtual Reality revolution";430213-virtual-reality-revolution;"The potential of Virtual Reality (VR) symbolises many of the most positive perceptions of the future. The idea of fully immersive, realistic digital environments that can allow you to get completely lost in another world or a gripping narrative (or both) is incredibly enticing. In popular culture, probably the most famous example is the ‘Star Trek’ holodeck. Whilst a couple of episodes did explore the potential negative impacts of such technology (the notion of ‘holo addiction’), the holodeck was seen overall as a positive technological development, in line with that classic show’s generally utopian view of the future. Of course, there are some cultural works that have expressed a more cautious tone to VR or even a dire dystopian warning alarm, again the most famous example probably being 1999’s seminal film ‘The Matrix’. But VR technology doesn’t seem to cause as much unease amongst the general population in terms of possible negative impacts on human society as other emerging technologies do, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) or widespread robotic automation.";;;;;;en;de,en,es,fr,it,pl;"2021-06-09 14:00:17";https://cordis.europa.eu/article/id/430213-virtual-reality-revolution
